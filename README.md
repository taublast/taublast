## Hi there 👋

🚀 What’s up?  
I’m a full-stack freelance developer working on mobile apps with .NET MAUI and everything .NET has to offer.

🔹 Optimizing UI Performance  
I replace as many default controls as possible with fast, custom-drawn alternatives to avoid platform-specific quirks.

🎨 Pushing DrawnUI Forward  
This work contributes to the development of [DrawnUI for .NET MAUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui), moving toward a future where fully drawn .NET MAUI apps become the norm.
