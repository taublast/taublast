## Hi there 👋

🚀 What’s up?  
I’m a full-stack freelance developer working on .NET MAUI mobile apps, web apps and services.

🔹 Optimizing UI Performance  
I tend to replace native controls with fast, custom-drawn alternatives, sometimes even making entire apps drawn on a single canvas.

🎨 Pushing drawn approach forward  
This work contributes to the development of [DrawnUI for .NET MAUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui), moving toward a future where fully drawn .NET MAUI apps become the norm.
